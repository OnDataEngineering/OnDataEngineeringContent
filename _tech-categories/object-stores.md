title: "Object Stores"
description: "Storage solutions whereby data is stored without any concept of folders or organisational structure, instead being referenced by a unique identifier and accessed via a REST API rather than a traditional filesystem API.  Generally designed to be massively parallel and scalable, and often supports a range of features including support for storage of custom metadata against data, replication of data for redundancy, tiered storage and object versioning.  Often most associated with cloud services, but increasing available as on-site deployable software."
