Tools that enable the execution of data queries across multiple data sources.  Most support the ability to create a semantic layer or virtual data schema across the underlying data sources (including the caching or materialization of tables within this layer and the ability to update it and therefore the underlying data sources) alongside the ability to run arbitrary queries across the underlying data (including in some cases the ability to do this without first defining the schema of the data in these sources).  Query logic is pushed down where possible so that it's executed in the underlying data source, with joins and aggregation of data from multiple sources then performed within the data virtualisation layer.  Sometimes referred to as data federation.

## Further Information

The following analyst material covers a number of technologies in this category:

* [Gartner Magic Quadrant & Critical Capabilities for Data Integration Tools](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=Gartner+\"Data+Integration+Tools\")
* [Gartner Market Guide for Data Virtualization](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=Gartner+\"Data+Virtualization\")
* [Forrester Wave: Enterprise Data Virtualization](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=Forrester+\"Data+Virtualization\")

A number of [Query Engines](/tech-categories/query-engines/) support joins and aggregation of data from multiple data sources

## "Enterprise" Vendors

The following are capabilities that exist as part of wider data integration and management product suites:

| Informatica Platform | <https://www.informatica.com/gb/products/data-integration/real-time-integration/data-virtualization.html>
| IBM Infosphere Federation Server | <http://www-03.ibm.com/software/products/da/ibminfofedeserv>
