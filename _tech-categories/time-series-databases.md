Databases optimised for storing very large numbers of metrics and allowing these to be aggregated and analysed.  Metrics are usually organised by measurements or metric names and one or more tags (e.g. to represent a server or instance).  Many implement their own data storage layers, however many also run over external databases, typically NoSQL wide data stores.  Use cases traditionally focus on monitoring infrastructure and applications or more recently IoT use cases, but analytics over any timestamped data is fair game.

## Further Information

DB Engines maintain a list of time series databases along with their current popularity: <https://db-engines.com/en/ranking/time+series+dbms>

From Steven Acreman on the Outlyer blog, a review of Time Series Databases from August 2016, some interesting thoughts, and a detailed analysis Google spreadsheet: <https://blog.outlyer.com/top10-open-source-time-series-databases>

## Open Source over external data stores

| [OpenTSDB](/technologies/opentsdb/) | Time Series DB that runs over Apache HBase |

## Monitoring Stacks (open source)

The following stacks support monitoring infrastructure and applications, with connectors to import metrics from a number of sources:

| Graphite | Three tier stack consisting of Whisper (simple time series database, graphite-web (a graph/dashboard UI) and Carbon (for ingestion of data)- <https://graphiteapp.org/>
| Prometheus | Open source monitoring solution that includes a time series database and alerting; part of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation - <https://prometheus.io/>
| Hawkular | Open source monitoring solution over Cassandra with alerting and visualisation capabilities, backed by RedHat - <http://www.hawkular.org/>
| NetData | Local in memory metrics dashboards for monitoring servers and applications, with the ability to forward metrics to downstream time series dbs - <https://my-netdata.io/>
| Icinga | Commercial support available - <https://www.icinga.com/>

## Monitoring Stacks (as a service)

If you're looking for a time series database to handle monitoring and management of infrastructure and applications, there are also a number of cloud based services you could consider:
