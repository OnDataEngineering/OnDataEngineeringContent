All tech category pages should start with a description of the category, including a description of the functionality or features that a technology must have to be considered part of this category, followed by an excerpt separator.  This will be prefixed by a "Category Definition" header on the rendered page.

All technology category pages live within the _tech-categories folder, and follow the standard Jekyll filename convention (the page title in lowercase with hyphens instead of spaces and any punctuation removed).

Further information on the technology category can be added here in the content after the excerpt separator, starting with a level 2 header.

In the content development site the list of associated technologies will be shown after after the Category Definition header and the excerpt but before any other content.  This does not appear on the final site, but is included for reference on the development site.

A list of related blog posts that reference this category via a tag will be automatically added to the end of the page.

And if you haven't already see http://ondataengineering.net/site/contributing/ for information on contributing, including information on the use of Git, GitHub and Markdown.
