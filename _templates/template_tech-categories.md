All technology category pages live within the _tech-categories folder, and follow the  standard Jekyll filename convention (the page title in lowercase with hyphens instead of spaces and any punctuation removed.

Further information on the technology category can be added here in the content, starting with a level 2 header.  This will appear after a list of the technologies in this category, and before a list of blog posts that reference this category via a tag (all of which is automatically inserted).

And if you haven't already see http://ondataengineering.net/site/contributing/ for information on contributing, including information on the use of Git, GitHub and Markdown.
