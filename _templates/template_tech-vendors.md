The plan is to only create technology vendor pages for vendors that have broad (and complex) products. Vendors with only one or two products probably don't warrant their own vendor page.

All technology vendor pages live within the _tech-vendors folder, and follow the standard Jekyll filename convention (the page title in lowercase with hyphens instead of spaces and any punctuation removed.

If you haven't already see http://ondataengineering.net/site/contributing/ for information on contributing, including information on the use of Git, GitHub and Markdown.

Further information on the technology vendor can be added here in the content, starting with a level 2 header.  This will appear after the vendor metadata and a list of the vendor technologies, and before a list of blog posts that reference this vendor via a tag (all of which is automatically inserted).  Recommended sections to include for each vendor are:

## Links

Links to the vendors homepage and to other useful information, for example as bullet points:

* link - descriptions

## News

Links to web pages, blogs, e-mail lists etc. that can be used to subscribe to information on this vendor.  We'll try and follow any news links ourselves.  For example as bullet points:

* link - description
