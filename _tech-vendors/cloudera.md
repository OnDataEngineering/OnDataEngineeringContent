## Vendor Technologies

Cloudera's offerings are based around [CDH](/technologies/cloudera-cdh/), their distribution of Apache Hadoop, which includes a number of commercial components including [Cloudera Manager](/technologies/cloudera-manager/) (for creating and managing clusters), [Cloudera Navigator](/technologies/cloudera-navigator/) (a data management and encryption solution) and [Cloudera Director](/technologies/cloudera-director/) (for installing CDH on cloud based platforms).

Cloudera also offer [Cloudera Data Science Workbench](/technologies/cloudera-data-science-workbench), a docker powered analytics notebook, and [Cloudera Altus](/technologies/cloudera-altus), a managed service for running Spark, MapReduce or Hive workloads on AWS or Azure.

The Cloudera technologies for managing metadata, data governance and security are collectively referred to as the Cloudera Shared Data Experience (SDX), as they enable multiple workloads to run over a shared set of data on a Cloudera Hadoop cluster.  Cloudera also provide an SDX Cloud Reference Architecture, which describes a shared data layer using cloud object storage, a shared metadata, data governance and security layer, and then support for multiple transient workloads on top (e.g. via Cloudera Altus).

Cloudera have donated a number of projects to the Apache Foundation, including [Flume](/technologies/apache-flume), [Sqoop](/technologies/apache-sqoop), [Avro](/technologies/apache-avro), [Parquet](/technologies/apache-parquet), [Crunch](/technologies/apache-crunch), [Sentry](/technologies/apache-sentry), [Impala](/technologies/apache-impala), [Kudu](/technologies/apache-kudu) and [Livy](/technologies/apache-livy), and have a number of non-Apache open source projects including [RecordService](/technologies/recordservice), [Hue](/technologies/hue), [Kite](/technologies/kite) and [Llama](/technologies/llama).
