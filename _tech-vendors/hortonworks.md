## Vendor Technologies

Hortonworks have two primary offerings - [Hortonworks Data Platform](/technologies/hortonworks-data-platform/), a fully open source distribution of Hadoop, and [Hortonworks Data Flow](/technologies/hortonworks-data-flow/), a distribution of (primarily) Apache NiFi, Kafka and Storm for processing data in motion.

Both offerings are installed and managed through [Apache Ambari](/technologies/apache-ambari/), with Hortonworks Data Platform also including [Cloudbreak](/technologies/cloudbreak/), a technology for deploying and managing Hadoop clusters on cloud infrastructure.

The [Hortonworks Data Platform](/technologies/hortonworks-data-platform/) is available for Windows, which uses a standard Windows installer rather than Ambari, and includes a more limited set of technologies.

The [Hortonworks Data Platform](/technologies/hortonworks-data-platform/) is also available as a number of managed cloud offerings - on Azure as HDInsight, a Microsoft branded offering, and on AWS as [Hortonworks Data Cloud for AWS](/technologies/hortonworks-data-cloud-for-aws/), available via the AWS Marketplace.
