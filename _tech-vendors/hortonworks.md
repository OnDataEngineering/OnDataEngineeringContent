## Vendor Technologies

Hortonworks have two primary offerings - [Hortonworks Data Platform](/technologies/hortonworks-data-platform/) (HDP), a fully open source distribution of Hadoop, and [Hortonworks Data Flow](/technologies/hortonworks-data-flow/) (HDF), a distribution of (primarily) Apache NiFi, Kafka and Storm for processing data in motion.  The linked technology pages include further information of the options for deploying and managing these products.  They also provide [Hortonworks DataPlane Service](/technologies/hortonworks-dataplane-service/), a commercial product for managing and governing data, and Hortonworks Operational Services, a subscription service whereby Hortonworks engineers and support personnel manage your HDP or HDF instances on site or in the cloud.

Hortonworks also offer the Hortonworks Cybersecurity Package (HCP), a cyber security platform built on HDP and HDF that's based on the Apache Metron open source project, and which is installable and manageable via Apache Ambari.

Hortonworks have strong partnerships with both Pivotal and IBM, with those companies reselling Hortonworks products (primarily HDP), and Hortonworks reselling their products - specifically Apache HAWQ / Pivotal HDB (as Hortonworks HDB, an addon to HDP), IBM Data Science Experience (DSX) (a public or private cloud based web based notebook for interactive data analytics), and IBM BigSQL (a SQL engine that runs on Hadoop over Hive tables).

Hortonworks have donated a number of projects to the Apache Foundation including [Ambari](/technologies/apache-ambari), [Tez](/technologies/apache-tez), [Knox](/technologies/apache-knox), [Ranger](/technologies/apache-ranger) and [Slider](/technologies/apache-slider).  They also have a number of non-Apache open source tools including [Cloudbreak](/technologies/cloudbreak), [Schema Registry](/technologies/schema-registry/) and [Streaming Analytics Manager](/technologies/streaming-analytics-manager), all of which Hortonworks have suggested they will donate it to the Apache Foundation.
