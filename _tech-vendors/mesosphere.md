description: "Mesosphere is a commercial company developing the Mesosphere Datacenter Operating System (DC/OS). DC/OS is built around Apache Mesos and is itself an open source project. They are therefore extremely active in the open source space. Their business model is to sell subscription licenses based around an Enterprise version of DC/OS, provide training and support for DC/OS and partner-supported technologies. Mesosphere was founded in May 2013 by ex-engineers from Twitter and Airbnb."
