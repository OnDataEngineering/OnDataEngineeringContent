title: "Alluxio"
description: "A distributed virtual storage layer, supporting key-value and filesystem interfaces (including HDFS compatibility and a FUSE driver) with support for a range of computation and storage frameworks (including Spark, MapReduce, HBase and Hive) over multiple storage layers (including in-memory, local, network, cloud and cluster file systems) with the ability to create unified and tiered storage, for example to create an in memory filesystem backed by disk to accelerate analytics jobs.  Supports a POSIX like access control model, and a CLI and web interface for browsing the storage layer.  Java based, Open Source under the Apache 2.0 licence, hosted on GitHub, with development led by Alluxio (with significant external contributions), although they don't appear to yet provide commercial support (but do provide training).  Started in December 2012, open sourced in April 2013, with a v1.0 release in February 2016.  Formally known as Tachyon."
