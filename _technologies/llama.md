description: "Framework for long running low-latency distributed applications to request resources from YARN, built to support Apache Impala.  Operates as an un-managed YARN application master (that handles resource requests over a Thrift API and delivers resource notifications) and a node manager plugin (that delivers resource availability information to co-located services).  Created by Cloudera in August 2013, hosted on GitHub and available under an Apache 2.0 licence, and maintained by Cloudera to support new Impala and CDH releases."
