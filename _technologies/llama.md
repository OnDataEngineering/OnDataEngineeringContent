title: "Llama"
description: "Framework for long running low-latency distributed applications to request resources from YARN, built to support Apache Impala.  Operates as an un-managed YARN application master (that handles resource requests over a Thrift API and delivers resource notifications) and a node manager plugin (that delivers resource availability information to co-located services).  Created by Cloudera in August 2013 and hosted on GitHub under an Apache 2.0 licence.  Maintained by Cloudera to support new Impala and CDH releases, but now deprecated and will no longer be included in CDH from v6.0 onwards."
