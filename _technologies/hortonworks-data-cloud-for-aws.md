title: "Hortonworks Data Cloud for AWS"
description: "Service that supports the creation and management of HDP clusters on Amazon Web Services (AWS).  Management is done through a Cloud Controller AWS Product that provides a web interface and CLI for orchestrating the creation of AWS resources and the deployment of clusters using Ambari, and the subsequent scaling or cloning of the cluster.  Supports a number of standard cluster types, including Data Science (Spark, Zeppelin), EDW-ETL (Hive, Spark) and EDW-Analytics (Hive, Zeppelin), with clusters also including Tez, Pig and Scoop, along with a number of standard node types, including worker nodes (that support HDFS and YARN) and computer nodes (that only support YARN).  Clusters are designed to be ephemeral, however Amazon RDS can be used to provide persistent storage of Cloud Controller and Hive metadata, and Amazon S3 can be used to provide persistent cluster storage.  Also supports Hortonworks SmartSense, cluster templates, the use of Spot Instances for compute nodes, and node recipes for executing custom scripts pre/post the Ambari cluster setup.  Comes with free community support from Hortonworks.  First launched in November 2016, but appears to be discontinued as of HDP 3.0 with Hortonworks move to a multi cloud strategy via Cloudbreak"
