title: "GraphX"
description: "Spark library for processing graphs and running graph algorithms, based on graph model that supports directional edges with properties on both vertices and edges.  Graphs are constructed from a pair of collections representing the edges and vertex, either directly from data on disk using builders, or prepared using other Spark functionality, with the ability to also view the graph as a set of triples.  Supports a range of graph operations, as well as an optimised variant of the Pregel API, and a set of out of the box algorithms (including PageRank, connected components and triangle count).  First introduced in Spark 0.9, with a production release as part of Spark 1.2, however has seen almost no new functionality since then."
