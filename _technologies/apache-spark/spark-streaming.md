title: "Spark Streaming"
description: "Spark library for continuous stream processing, that allows stream and batch processing (including Spark SQL and MLlib operations) to be combined. Uses a micro-batch execution model, leveraging core Spark to process each micro-batch, and provides fault tolerance through exactly-once processing semantics.  Supports a number of data sources (including HDFS, sockets, Flume, Kafka, Kinesis and messaging buses), as well as functions to maintain state and to execute windowed operations. First introduced in Spark 0.7, with a production release as part of Spark 0.9."
