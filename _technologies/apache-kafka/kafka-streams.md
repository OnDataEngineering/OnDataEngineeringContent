title: "Kafka Streams"
description: "Technology that allows stream processing to be added to a Kafka cluster, consuming and publishing events from and to Kafka topics (and potentially writing output to external systems). Based on an event-at-a-time model (i.e. not micro batch), with support for stateful processing, windowing, joining and re-processing data.  Supports a low level DSL API, as well as a high level API that provides both stream and table abstractions (where tables present the latest record for each key). Introduced in Kafka 0.10."
