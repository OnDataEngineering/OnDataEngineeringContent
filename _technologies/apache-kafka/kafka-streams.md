title: "Kafka Streams"
description: "A stream processing technologies that's tightly integrated to Apache Kafka, consuming and publishing events from and to Kafka topics (and potentially writing output to external systems).  Based on an event-at-a-time model (i.e. not micro batch), with support for stateful processing, windowing, aggregations, joining and re-processing data.  Supports a low level DSL API, as well as a high level API that provides both stream and table abstractions (where tables present the latest record for each key).  Executes as a stand-alone process, with support for parallel processing across threads within a single instance and across multiple instances, with the ability to dynamically scale the number of instances.  Introduced in Kafka 0.10."
