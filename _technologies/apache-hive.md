title: "Apache Hive"
description: "Technology that supports the exposure of data in Hadoop as structured tables and the execution of analytical SQL queries over these.  Consists of a number of distinct components (that we treat as sub-projects) including Hive Metastore (stores the definitions of the structured tables), Hive Server (supports the execution of analytical SQL queries as MapReduce, Spark or Tez jobs) and HCatalog (allows MapReduce and Pig jobs to read and write Hive tables).  First released by Facebook as an Hadoop contrib module in September 2008, becoming an Hadoop sub-project in November 2008, and a top level Apache project in September 2010, following a first official stable release (0.3) in April 2009.  Java based, under active development from a number of large commercial sponsors, with commercial support available as part of most Hadoop distributions."
