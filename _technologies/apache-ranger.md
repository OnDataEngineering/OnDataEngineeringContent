title: "Apache Ranger"
description: "A centralised security framework for managing access to data in Hadoop.  Supports integration with LDAP and Active Directory for user authentication, a central policy server/store (with a web based administration interface and REST API), and plugins for Hadoop components (including HDFS, Hive, HBase, Storm, Knox, Solr, Kafka, YARN, Atlas and NiFi) to manage authorisation of user access to data.  Supports data masking and row level access policies (currently only supported by Hive), the ability to define policies against tags as well as directly against resources (with tags assigned to resources externally, e.g. in Apache Atlas), and the ability to use more complex conditions (e.g. denying access after an expiration date or based on a users location).  Extendable with the ability to add support for new services (Ranger Stacks) and to add custom decision rules (via content enrichers and condition evaluators).  Also supports a full audit capability of access requests and decisions, and a key management service for HDFS encryption keys.  An Apache project, donated in July 2014 as Argus by the Hortonworks following their acquisition of XA Secure, graaduating in February 2017.  Reached v1.0 in March 2018, and is still under active development with a range of contributors."
