title: "Apache Ranger"
description: "A centralised security framework for managing access to data in Hadoop.  Supports integration with LDAP and Active Directory for user authentication, a web based administration interface, a REST API, and a central policy engine used by plugins within individual Hadoop components (including HDFS, Hive, HBase, Storm, Knox, Solr, Kafka, YARN, Atlas and NiFi).  Supports data access, data masking, and row level filtering policies (with masking and row level filtering currently only supported by Hive), the ability to define policies against tags as well as directly against resources (with tags assigned to resources externally, e.g. in Apache Atlas), and the ability to use more complex conditions (e.g. denying access after an expiration date or based on a users location).  Extendable with the ability to add support for new services (Ranger Stacks) and to add custom decision rules (via content enrichers and condition evaluators).  Also supports a full audit capability of access requests and decisions, and a key management service for HDFS encryption keys.  An incubating Apache project, donated in July 2014 by the Hortonworks following their acquisition of XA Secure.  Has not yet reached a v1.0 milestone, but is still under active development with a range of contributors."
