description: "An MPP query engine that supports queries over one or more underlying databases or datasets without first defining a schema and with the ability to join data from multiple datastores together.  Supports a range of underlying technologies including HDFS, NAS, HBase, MongoDB, MapR-DB, MapR-FS, Kafka, OpenTSDB, Amazon S3, Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage, JDBC, Avro, JSON and Parquet.  Pushes queries down to underlying datastores where possible, and supports an in-memory columnar datastore based on a schema free JSON document model for performing cross datastore query operations.  Supports dynamic schema discovery, with support for complex and nested types, including a number of SQL extensions.  Supports standard SQL, UDFs (including Hive UDFs) and comes with JDBC and ODBC drivers, a REST API, plus a shell, web console and C++ API. Designed to be horizontally scalable and to support high throughput and low latency use cases, and can run over YARN.  Supports Kerberos and username/password authentication, plus a full authorisation model. Created by MapR Based on Google's Dremel paper, donated to the Apache Foundation in September 2012, graduating in November 2014, with a 1.0 release in May 2015, and is still under active development"
