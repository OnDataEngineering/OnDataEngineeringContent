title: "Elasticsearch"
description: "A distributed search server built on Apache Lucene that supports a number of advanced analytics over search results.  Data is stored in indexes, with each index able to support multiple schemas (types), with the data itself sharded to support distributed parallel queries, with multiple replicas of each shard providing resilience and redundancy.  Supports both pre-defined and schemaless types, all standard Lucene functionality (including faceting, grouping, clustering, hit highlighting, geo support, near real time indexing), the ability to update and delete documents (by id or query), upsert operations, batch operations, re-indexing (from one index into a second index), generated or calculated fields, document versioning and optimistic concurrency control, nested searches based on sub-documents or explicit parent-child document links, templated searches, a range of aggregations (include support for metrics, bucketing results, matrix calculations and custom aggregations using pipelines), custom analysers for indexing data, custom transformation pipelines prior to indexing (via an ingest node), the ability to query across clusters (cross cluster search), a plugin framework, registered queries that are executed against newly indexed data (percolation) and the ability to snapshot and restore indexes using HDFS, S3, Azure and Google Cloud.  Comes with a REST API, with clients available for a range of languages including Java, C#, Python, JavaScript, PHP, Perl and Ruby.  First released in February 2010, with a 1.0 release in February 2014.  Development is led by Elastic, who were formed in 2012 by the creator of Elasticsearch and a lead Lucene contributor, and who provide commercial support, a number of commercial add-ons (Elastic X-Pack) and an on-site or on-AWS cloud service (Elastic Cloud)."
