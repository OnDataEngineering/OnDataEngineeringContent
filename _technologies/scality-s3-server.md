Written in Node.js, and focused on dev/test use cases, as it is not a distributed system and does not support data replication or other features often found in object servers.  First released in June 2016, hosted on GitHub under an Apache 2.0 licence, with commercial support available from Scality (as Scality S3 Enterprise Edition)."
