title: "Hortonworks DataPlane"
redirect_from: /technologies/hortonworks-dataplane-service/
description: "An extensible platform for managing data ecosystems, with capabilities delivered through plugable applications.  Supports the registration and management of DataPlane applications and the registration of Ambari managed clusters that are then accessible to these applications.  Supports role based access control, with LDAP integration for users and groups and support for app specific roles.  Runs on docker, with state held in an external database, and integrates with Knox (for SSO and access to clusters).  Future services referenced include Cloudbreak and IBM DSX.  Stated plan is for this to be a cloud service, however this is not currently generally available, and the documentation currently details installation steps for a local machine. First released in November 2017."
