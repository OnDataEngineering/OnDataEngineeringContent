title: "Apache Tez"
description: "Data processing framework based on Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), that runs natively on YARN and was designed to be a replacement for the use of MapReduce within Hadoop analytical tools (primarily Hive and Pig), and therefore offer better performance with similar scalability.  Targeted more at application developers rather than data engineers, includes a number of performance optimisations (including dynamic DAG re-configuration during execution and re-use of sessions and containers), and comes with a UI for viewing live and historic Tez job executions based on information in the YARN Application Timeline Server.  Created by Hortonworks and donated to the Apache Foundation in February 2013 before graduating in July 2014.  Still under active development, and now used by Cascading and Flink in addition to Hive and Pig."
