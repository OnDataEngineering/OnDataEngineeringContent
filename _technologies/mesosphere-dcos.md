title: "Mesosphere DC/OS"
description: "A distributed, hybrid-cloud operating system for elastic stateless micro services running in containers and stateful big data services, ensuring high datacenter utilization. At its core, Apache Mesos handles job scheduling, resource management and abstraction, high availability, infrastructure-level processes and pluggable containerizers for both Docker and native Mesos containers. Combined with Marathon, provides a container orchestration platform with support for launching, managing, scaling and networking containers. Focused on ease of use, provides an app-store-like service catalog (Universe) to install complex distributed systems including HDFS, Apache Spark, Apache Kafka, Apache Cassandra, CI/CD applications such as Jenkins, all of which have been optimised to run on Apache Mesos and a web interface for monitoring and management. Comes in two flavors; a free community edition for installation in the cloud and a commercial enterprise edition for on-premises, in the cloud, or across a hybrid environment and includes monitoring tools, support for enterprise security and compliance tools, advanced networking, and load balancing features. Offered via a subscription license, the enterprise edition also includes product support. Open sourced in April 2016 under the Apache 2.0 license, under active development led by Mesosphere with a range of contributors including Microsoft."
