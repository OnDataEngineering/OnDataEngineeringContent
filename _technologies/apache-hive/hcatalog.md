title: "HCatalog"
description: "Libraries for MapReduce and Pig to read and write data to and from Hive tables, albeit with some limitations. Also supports a CLI for querying and updating the Hive Metastore, however this doesn't support the full range of Hive DDL commands.  Includes WebHCat, a REST API over the HCatalog CLI that also supports the execution of MapReduce, Pig, Hive and Sqoop jobs.  Donated to the Apache foundation by Yahoo in March 2011, had WebHCat folded in in July 2012, graduating as a top level project in February 2013, but then almost immediately was folded into Hive in March 2013 as part of the Hive 0.11 release.  Has seem limited development since this time."
