description: "A metadata service that allows structured tables to be defined over files in HDFS (and also HBase or Accumulo), providing an API that allows the metadata to be queried and updated by other tools including Impala, Spark SQL or RecordService.  Supports partitioned and clustered tables, as well as complex field types such as arrays, maps and structs.  Backed by a relational database (either MySQL, Postgres and Oracle).  Part of the original Hive code base."
