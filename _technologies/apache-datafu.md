title: "Apache DataFu"
description: "A set of libraries for working with data in Hadoop.  Consists of two sub-projects - DataFu Pig (a set of Pig User Defined Functions) and DataFu Hourglass (a framework for incremental processing using MapReduce).  Originally created at LinkedIn, with the Pig UDFs being open sourced in January 2012 as DataFu, with a v1.0 release in September 2013.  Split into sub-projects in October 2013 when LinkedIn open sourced DataFu Hourglass and added it to the project.  Donated to the Apache Foundation in January 2014, however is still incubating and has not yet graduated.  Last release was v1.3 in November 2015 (albeit with a very minor v1.3.1 release in August 2016), with little development activity since this time."
