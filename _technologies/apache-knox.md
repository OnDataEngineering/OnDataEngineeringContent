title: "Apache Knox"
description: "A stateless gateway for the Apache Hadoop ecosystem that provides perimeter security.  Includes support for user authentication (via LDAP, Active Directory and a number of single sign on solutions), access authorisation on a per service basis, transitions to Kerberos authentication, reverse proxying and auditing, extension points for supporting new services, audit capabilities, and out of the box support for a number of Hadoop technology end points.  An Apache project, started by Hortonworks in February 2013, donated to the Apache Foundation two months later in April, before graduating in February 2014. Hasn't yet reached a v1.0 milestone, however still under active development."
