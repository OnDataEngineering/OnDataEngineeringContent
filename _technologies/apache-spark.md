Requires a cluster manager (YARN, EC2 and Mesos are supported as well as standalone clusters) and can access data in a wide range of technologies (including HDFS, other Hadoop data sources, relational databases and NoSQL databases).  An Apache project, originally started at UC Berkley in 2009, open sourced in 2010, and donated to the Apache foundation in June 2013, graduating in February 2014.  v1.0 was released in May 2014, with a v2.0 release in July 2016.
