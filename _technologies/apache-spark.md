title: "Apache Spark"
description: "A high performance general purpose distributed data processing engine based on directed acyclic graphs that primarily runs in memory, but can spill to disk if required, and which supports processing applications written in Java, Scala, Python and R (SparkR).  Includes a number of sub-projects that support more specialised analytics including Spark SQL (batch and streaming analytics using declarative logic over structured data), Spark Streaming (micro-batch stream processing), MLlib (machine learning) and GraphX (graph analytics).  Requires a cluster manager (YARN, EC2, Kubernetes and Mesos are supported as well as standalone clusters) and can access data in a wide range of technologies (including HDFS, other Hadoop data sources, relational databases and NoSQL databases).  An Apache project, originally started at UC Berkley in 2009, open sourced in 2010, and donated to the Apache foundation in June 2013, graduating in February 2014.  v1.0 was released in May 2014, with a v2.0 release in July 2016.  Java based, with development led by Databricks (who sell a Spark hosted service), and with commercial support available as part of most Hadoop distributions."
