title: "MapR-ES"
description: "Technology for buffering and storing real-time streams of data, built over MapR-FS, with support for a Kafka compatible API.  Messages (key/value pairs where the key is optional) are organised into topics, which are partitioned and stored as first class objects within MapR-FS volumes, with topics then grouped into streams.  Supports encryption of streams, automatic deletion of messages (via a time to live), consumer groups, authorisation using ACEs (access control expressions), plus replication of topics to one or more remote MapR-ES instances either synchronously or asynchronously, including support for Kafka's MirrorMaker.  Comes with Java, C and Python libraries and includes a Kafka compatible API. Introduced in MapR 5.1 in Feb 2016.  Previously called MapR Streams."
