title: "Microsoft Azure Blob Storage"
description: "An object store service with strong consistency, with support for multiple blob types (block, page and append), multiple storage tiers (premium, hot, cold and archive) and deep integration to the Azure ecosystem.  Block blobs are comprised of one or more blocks with operations done at the block level with changes made visible via a final commit; page blobs are collections of 512-byte pages optimised for random read and write operations against one or more pages; and append blobs only support modification via the addition of new data to the end of the blob.  Objects are organised into containers and indexed by string, with the option to list objects by prefix and to summarise results based on a delimiter allowing a filesystem to be approximated.  Supports name-value pair metadata against containers and objects, both optimistic and pessimistic (lock based) concurrency, snapshots (providing read only access to objects as they were when the snapshot was taken), soft deletes (allowing previous versions of objects to be recovered), immutable blobs, lifecycle management (in public preview), access control via access tokens (shared access signatures), public access to containers, configurable geo redundancy, encryption of objects (Azure Storage Service Encryption - SSE) and support for SSL connections, multi-part uploads, the use of custom domains, and logging and metrics (Azure Storage Analytics).  Provides a REST API, web app (Azure Storage Explorer), a range of SDKs, a CLI and PowerShell integration."
