title: "Apache Slider (incubating)"
description: "Framework for hosting long running distributed applications on YARN, allowing YARN to manage the resources these applications use.  Can handle any application that supports a base set of requirements (including being able to install and run from a tarball), with experimental support for docker packaged applications.  Operates as a YARN application master (the Slider AM), an associated command line interface and lightweight agents to manage running components.  Supports manual scaling, automatic recovery, rolling upgrades and component placement controls, and includes out of the box configuration for a number of applications including Accumulo, HBase, Kafka, Memcached, Solr, Storm and Tomcat.  An incubating Apache project, originally donated in April 2014 based on the Hortonworks Hoya (HBase on YARN) project, and subsequently consumed the DataTorrent Koya (Kafka on YARN) project. Hasn't yet reached a v1.0 milestone,  development activity is effectively stopped following the plan to add support for long running services directly into YARN under YARN-4692, and as of HDP 3.0 will no longer be distributed by Hortonworks."
