title: "Apache Hadoop"
description: "A distributed storage and compute platform consisting of a distributed filesystem (HDFS) and a cluster workload and resource management layer (YARN), along with MapReduce, a solution built on HDFS and YARN for massive scale parallel processing of data. Has an extensive ecosystem of compatible technologies. An Apache Open Source project, started in January 2006 as a Lucene sub-project, becoming a top level project in January 2008, with a 1.0 release in December 2011 (containing HDFS and MapReduce), and a 2.2 release (the first 2.x GA release) in October 2013 (adding YARN).  Work is currently underway to split out the data storage layer of HDFS (the HDDS sub-project) and to implement an object store on top of this that can co-exist with HDFS (the Ozone sub-project).  Very active, with a deep and broad range of contributors, and backing from multiple commercial vendors."
