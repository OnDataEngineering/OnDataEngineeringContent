title: "Apache Mahout"
description: "Machine learning technology comprising of a Scala based linear algebra engine (codenamed Samsara) with an R-like DSL/API that runs over Spark (with experimental support for H2O and Flink), an optimiser, a wide variety of pre-made algorithms, and a Scala REPL (based on Spark Shell) for interactive execution. Can be embedded and integrated within larger applications, for example MLlib when running over Spark.  Also includes some original, now deprecated, algorithms implemented over MapReduce.  Created in January 2008 as a Lucene sub-project, becoming a top level Apache project in April 2010.  The original MapReduce algorithms were deprecated and Samsara introduced as part of v0.10 in April 2015.  Supported by most major Hadoop distributions, and still under active development."
