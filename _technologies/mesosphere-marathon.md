title: "Mesosphere Marathon"
description: "A framework for Apache Mesos and Mesosphere's Datacenter Operating System (DC/OS) to launch long-running services in a clustered environment and ensure that they continue to run in the event of a hardware or software failure. Implemented as a Mesos framework, leverages Mesos for resource allocation and isolation and provides a REST API and web interface for service definition, discovery and management. Provides constraints control to support service placement for high-available and locality, an event bus and health checking to support rolling deployments and upgrades. Provides local and external persistent storage and resurrection on the same node in the event of a failure to support stateful services (in beta). Often used as an orchestrator for other applications and services, can be run in highly-available mode by running multiple copies of the framework and using ZooKeeper to perform leader election in the event on an failure. Written in Scala, open sourced under the Apache 2.0 license, hosted on GitHub, with development led by Mesosphere who also distribute it as part of their Mesosphere's Datacenter Operating System (DC/OS) commercial offering."
