title: "Zenko"
description: "A distributed and resilient Amazon S3 API compatible object storage gateway / proxy. Utilises Zenko CloudServer (previously S3 Server) to provide an S3 compatible API, to proxy requests to either Scality RING, Amazon S3, Azure Blob Storage or Google Cloud Storage, and to provide persistent local storage or transient in-memory storage.  Current solution is a Docker Swarm stack of a cluster of Zenko CloudServer instances with nginx as a front end load balancer.  Manageable via Zenko Orbit, a cloud based portal.  Roadmap includes support for Azure Blob Storage, support for other container management systems such as Kubernetes, plus two new sub-projects - Backbeat (which will provide policy-based data workflows such as replication or migration) and Clueso (which will provide object metadata search and analytics using Apache Spark).  First released in July 2017, and hosted on GitHub under an Apache 2.0 licence."
