title: "Zenko"
description: "A distributed and resilient Amazon S3 API compatible object storage gateway / proxy.  Current scope is a Docker Swarm stack of a cluster of Zenko CloudServer (previously S3 Server) instances with nginx as a front end load balancer, which provide the S3 compatible API backed by Scality RING or Amazon S3, as well as persistent local storage or transient in-memory storage via a shared CloudServer data and metadata daemon.  Roadmap includes support for Azure Blob Storage, support for other container management systems such as Kubernetes, plus two new sub-projects - Backbeat (which will provide policy-based data workflows such as replication or migration) and Clueso (which will provide object metadata search and analytics using Apache Spark).  First released in July 2017, and hosted on GitHub under an Apache 2.0 licence."
