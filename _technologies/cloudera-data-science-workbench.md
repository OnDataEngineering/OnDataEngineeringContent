title: "Cloudera Data Science Workbench"
description: "A web based notebook for interactive data analytics that uses docker to provide custom execution environments for each notebook.  Supports Python, R and Scala interpreters, plus remote execution of Spark with out of the box support for Hadoop security.  Notebook code is run within a docker container in a managed Kubernetes instance, allowing different libraries to be installed and used by different notebooks, and other dependancies to be installed via terminal access to the container or via custom Docker images.  Also includes support for version control (via git), collaboration via shared projects, sharing of notebooks via HTTP URLs, publishing of notebooks as HTML and scheduled execution of notebooks via workflows (including dependancies on other jobs).  Originally created by Sense.io, which was acquired by Cloudera in March 2016.  Initial GA release was 1.0 in April 2017."
