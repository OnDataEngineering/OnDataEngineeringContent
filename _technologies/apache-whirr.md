description: "A set of libraries (now moved to the Apache Attic and no longer maintained) for deploying and managing a supported set of services in a cloud environment.  Written in Java, with explicit support for a set of standard services (including Hadoop, Cassandra, HBase, Elasticsearch and Solr) configured through property files.  Uses jclouds to provision and manage cloud infrastructure, and provides both a CLI and Java API.  Originally a set of python scripts maintained as an Hadoop contrib project.  Donated to the Apache Foundation in May 2010, graduating in August 2011.  Development ceased in September 2012, with the project being moved to the Apache Attic in March 2015."
