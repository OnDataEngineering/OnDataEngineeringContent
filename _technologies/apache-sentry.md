title: "Apache Sentry"
description: "A centralised security framework for managing access to data in Hadoop.   Supports integration with LDAP and Active Directory for user authentication, a central policy server/store, and plugins for Hadoop components (including Hive, Solr, Impala and HDFS, with support for Kafka and Sqoop2 in preview) to manage authorisation of user access to data, although HDFS support is limited to Hive data only.  Also supports row level filtering policies for Solr, and historical support for defining policies in files per service (Sentry Policy Files).  Integrates with the Hue security app (to manage permissions) and with Cloudera Navigator (for authorisation audit events).  Started in 2012 as Cloudera Access, with an initial 1.0 release in 2013 as Sentry.  Donated to the Apache Foundation in August 2013, graduating in March 2016. "
