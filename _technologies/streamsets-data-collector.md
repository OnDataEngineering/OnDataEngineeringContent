description: "General purpose technology for the movement of data between systems, including the ingestion of batch and streaming data into an analytical platform.  Pipelines are configured in a graphical user interface, and consist of a single origin, one or more processor stages and then one or more destinations, with support for a wide range of source/destination technologies and processor transformations.  Supports a wide range of data formats, executors (tasks that can be triggered based on events from pipelines, e.g. to send e-mails or run a shell script), handling of erroroneous records, support for CDC CRUD records, previewing of data within the editor UI, real-time reporting and alerting on a range of execution and data quality metrics, and the ability to dynamically handle changes to schemas and the semantic meaning of data.  Can run in standalone mode (as a single process, with the option to run single or multi-threaded) or as a Spark Straming or MapReduce job on a cluster.  Java based, Open Source under the Apache 2.0 licence, hosted on GitHub, with development led by StreamSets who also provide commercial support and a Dataflow Performance Manager commercial add on for for managing dataflow operations.
