title: "Apache Ambari"
description: "Platform for installing, managing and monitoring Apache Hadoop clusters.  Supports the installation of different versions of different distributions of Hadoop through Stack definitions (with support for HDP out of the box, and further stacks and add ons available through management packs), and the specification of Blueprints (cluster layouts and configuration for a given Stack) that can be used to programmatically create multiple clusters (e.g. dev, test and production).  Also supports both rolling (no downtime) and express (faster but with downtime) upgrades; cluster administration (including adding and removing nodes/services, viewing the status of nodes/services, and configuring services with the versioning of configuration and the ability to rollback changes); the automated Kerberization of clusters; the collection, storage (in HBase) and visualisation (via Grafana or through dashboards in Ambari) of system and Hadoop component metrics via the Ambari Metrics System (AMS); alerting on statuses and metrics; the collection, storage (in Solr) and searching/viewing of log entries from across the Hadoop cluster (currently in technical preview); and a framework for UI components within Ambari (Ambari Views, treated here as a sub-project).  Web based, with a REST API, and backed by a backend database (Oracle, MySQL or Postgres). Donated to the Apache Foundation by Hortonworks, IBM and Yahoo in August 2011 as the Hadoop Management System (HMS), graduating in December 2013 after changing it's name to Ambari.  Still under active development with a large number of contributors."
