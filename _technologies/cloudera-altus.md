title: "Cloudera Altus"
description: "Platform for accessing individual CDH capabilities as services.  Currently supports the execution of Spark, MapReduce or Hive over Spark or MapReduce jobs (Altus Data Engineering), the dynamic provisioning of Impala clusters (Altus Analytical DB - in Beta), with a stated future plan for R- and Python-based machine learning workloads (Altus Data Science) and an HBase based operational database service.  Runs on Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure (see sub-projects for details as level of support differs) over external data in Amazon S3 or Azure Data Lake Storage, with a stated plan to expand support to other cloud service providers (specifically the Google Cloud Platform) in the future.  Also supports SDX, allowing Altus jobs to exploit a common central metadata service.  Supports a web based UI, a (Python) CLI and a Java SDK, with full user authentication and role based access management, and integration with AWS and Azure security.  Launched in May 2017, with a per node / per hour pricing model."
