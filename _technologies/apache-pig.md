title: "Apache Pig"
description: "Technology for running analytical and data processing jobs against data in Hadoop.  Jobs are written in Pig Latin (a custom procedural language that can be extended using user defined functions in a range of languages), which is then translated into Map Reduce or Tez (with Spark in preview) for execution.  Supports both a batch mode for running pre-defined scripts and an interactive mode, and connectors for reading and writing to HBase and Accumulo as well as HDFS.  Originally developed at Yahoo in 2006 before being donated to the Apache Foundation in October 2007.  Graduated as an Hadoop sub-project in October 2008, before becoming a top level project in September 2010.  Although has not had a v1.0 release, has been production quality for many years.  Commercial support available as part of most Hadoop distributions"
