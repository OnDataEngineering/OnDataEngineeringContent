title: "MapR Converged Data Platform"
description: "A data platform built around MapR-FS (along with MapR-DB and MapR-Streams) that provides Hadoop compatibility (via YARN and the MapR-FS HDFS compatible API) and is bundled with a package of Hadoop projects via the MapR Ecosystem Pack.  Comes with an installer (MapR Installer) and a web based user interface for management (MapR Control System).  Available as a single node version (for development and testing), as MapR Edge (a small footprint edition that can run on low power and embedded hardware close to data sources to perform initial data filtering and processing before forwarding data on to a central cluster via MapR replication), and as MapR Converged Data Platform for Docker (a marketing name for using the Converged Data Platform as persistent storage for docker containers, which is supported by the availability of PACC, the Persistent Application Client Container, a docker image containing the client libraries required for connecting to a MapR Converged Data Platform). Distributed as a free community edition (which excludes some enterprise features such as snapshots, high availability, disaster recovery and replication), and as a number of commercial editions. First released as MapR v1.0 in 2010"
