description: "A collection of open source components used to capture, store and visualise metrics and log messages across a MapR Converged Data Platform.  Components used include collectd (to capture metrics), OpenTSDB (a time-series database that runs on top of MapR-DB to store metrics), Grafana (to visualise and graph metrics into dashboards), FluentD (to collect and parse log messages), Elasticsearch (to store and index log messages for search) and Kibana (to search and view log messages).  Metrics captured include cpu, disk, memory and network metrics, plus metrics for Drill, YARN and the MapR components.  Log messages are captured from system logs, plus YARN, ZooKeeper, Drill, Hbase, Hive, Oozie, Spark, the MapR component logs, and the logs for the MapR Monitoring components.  Both Grafana and Kibana include starter sample dashboards.  First released in June 2016 as part of the Spyglass initiative."
