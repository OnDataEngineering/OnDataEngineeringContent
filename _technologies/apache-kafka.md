title: "Apache Kafka"
description: "Technology for buffering and storing real-time streams of data between publishers to subscribers, with a focus on high throughput at low latency.  Based on a distributed, horizontally scalable architecture, with messages organised into topics which are partitioned and replicated across nodes to provide resilience and written to disk to provide persistence.  Topics may have multiple publishers and subscribers, with ability to do fault tolerant reads and to load balance across subscribers.  Records consist of a key, value and timestamp, with the ability to compact topics to remove updates and deletes by key.  Supports a full security model, and the ability to set quotas.  Comes with a Java client, but clients for a wide range of languages are also available. Has two sub-projects (Kafka Connect and Kafka Streams) that are bundled with the main product.  Originally developed at LinkedIn, being open sourced in January 2011, before being donated to the Apache Foundation in July 2011.  Graduated in October 2012, and although it has not had a v1.0 release is considered production quality and stable. Development is primarily led by Confluent (which was founded by the team that built Kafka at LinkedIn), who distribute a Confluent Open Source product (which includes further clients and connectors) and a subscription based Confluent Enterprise product (which includes management, replication and data balancing features and commercial support under a subscription licence, and run a cloud based Confluent Cloud Service.  Commercial support is also available from most Hadoop vendors."
