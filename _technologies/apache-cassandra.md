title: "Apache Cassandra"
description: "Distributed key-value and column-oriented datastore based on Amazon Dynamo and Google BigTable. Focuses on high availability with built in support for multiple-data centre deployments, for redundancy, failover and disaster recovery. Based on a masterless design, data is distributed in a deterministic way across the nodes so that each node can service any request. Replication is network topology aware thereby ensuring replica placement avoids single points of failure. Data is indexed and written to a replicated structure providing any node fast lookup for queried data. For fast real-time ingestion of data, writes are done in append-only fashion to a commit log and obsolete data is discarded through compaction. Provides highly granular control over the trade-offs between consistency, availability, and performance. Supports horizontal scaling, eventual consistency and a simple interface named Cassandra Query Language (CSQL) resembling SQL for access. Does not support joins nor subqueries, rather, emphasises denormalisation through features like collections. An Apache project, graduating in February 2010, having been originally opened sourced in July 2008 by Facebook. Written in Java and under active development with major contributions from DataStax who distribute it as a part of their DataStax Enterprise offering, which includes integrated analytics, search, multi-model functionality, a graphical IDE for navigating Cassandra/DSE databases and building/running CQL statements against a database cluster and commercial support. Other commercial vendors include Instaclustr and Winguzone who provide hosted and managed Apache Cassandra as a service on a number of major cloud providers."
