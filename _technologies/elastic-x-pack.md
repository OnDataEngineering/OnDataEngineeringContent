description: "A set of commercial extensions to the Elastic open source products (Elasticsearch, Kibana and Logstash) including Security (formally Shield), Alerting (formally Watcher), Monitoring (formally Marvel), Reporting, Graph and Machine Learning. Security supports encryption of data and links, user authentication (via LDAP and Active Directory) and authorisation (at the cluster, index, document and field level for Elasticsearch and for access to Kibana) and full audit logging.  Monitoring supports captures metrics from Elasticsearch (for clusters, nodes and indexes), Kibana and Logstash, stores these in an Elasticsearch index and exposes them through a set of Kibana dashboards for real time and historical analysis.  Alerting supports the scheduling of Elasticsearch queries (e.g. over monitoring data), and configuration and extensible actions (including e-mail and a set of out of the box third party integrations) to be taken if a set of boolean or scripted conditions are met, along with a full history of alerts, all manageable through Kibana. Reporting supports the scheduled or triggered generation and distribution of reports based on Kibana visualisations or dashboards.  Graph adds new APIs and Kibana visualisations for working with relationships in data in Elasticsearch, with connections between indexed terms generated on the fly using Elasticsearch aggregations and relevance scoring.  Machine Learning adds automated anomaly detection on time-series data in Elasticsearch.  Also includes Profiler, a tool for visualising Elasticsearch profiler results.  A commercial product from Elastic, with basic monitoring and a search profiler available under a free licence."
