title: "Apache Calcite"
description: "A framework for building SQL based data access capabilities.  Supports a SQL parser and validator, tools for the transformation and (cost based) optimisation of SQL expression trees, and an adapter framework for accessing metadata and executing queries (including out of the box adapters for a number of database technologies as well as CSV files and POJO objects), along with specific support for streaming SQL queries and optimising data cube queries to use materialised views.  Also includes (as a sub-project named Avatica), a framework for building database drivers with support for a standard JDBC driver, server and wire protocols, plus a local embeddable JDBC driver.  Used in a range of other projects including Drill, Flink, Hive, Kylin, Phoenix, Samza, Storm and Cascading.  An Apache project, originally created by Julian Hyde in May 2012 as Optiq, donated to the Apache Foundation in May 2014, graduating in October 2015 following a v1.0 release in January 2015.  Under active development with a range of contributors."
