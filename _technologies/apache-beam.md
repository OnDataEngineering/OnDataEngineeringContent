title: "Apache Beam"
description: "Unified batch and streaming programming model to define and execute portable data processing pipelines. Originating from the Google Dataflow model, focuses on unifying both styles of processing by treating static data sets as streams (which happen to have a beginning and an end), while achieving data correctness and the ability to handle late-arriving data through a set of abstractions and concepts that give users control over estimated quality of arrived data (completeness), duration to wait for results (latency) and how much speculative/redundant computation to do (cost). Allows business logic, data characteristics and trade-off strategies to be defined via different programming languages through pluggable language SDKs (includes Java and Python) and provides a pluggable runtime platform through pipeline runners. Comes with a direct runner for development and testing pipelines in a non-distributed environment, Apache Apex, Flink, Spark, and Gearpump runners for executing pipelines on premise, distributed execution platforms or on self-managed cloud deployments, a Dataflow runner for execution on the Google Cloud Platform and a growing set of connectors that allow pipelines to read and write data to various data storage systems (IOs). An Apache project, graduating in January 2017, having been originally opened sourced in January 2016 by Google. Written in Java and Python and under active development with a large number of contributors including Google, data Artisans, Talend and PayPal."
