description: "Specialist technology for the continuous movement of data using a set of independent agents connected together into pipelines.  Supports a wide range of sources, targets and buffers (channels), along with the ability to chain agents together and to modify and drop events in-flight.  Designed to be highly reliable, and to support reconfiguration without the need for a restart.  Heavily integrated with the Hadoop ecosystem.  An Apache project, donated by Cloudera in June 2011, graduating in June 2012, with a v1.2 release (the first considered ready for production use) in July 2012. Java based, with commercial support available as part of most Hadoop distributions."
