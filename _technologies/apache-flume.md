Designed to be highly reliable, and to support reconfiguration without the need for a restart.  Heavily integrated with the Hadoop ecosystem.  An Apache project, donated by Cloudera in June 2011, graduating in June 2012, with a v1.2 release (the first considered ready for production use) in July 2012.
