title: "Denodo Platform"
description: "Data Virtualisation platform, enabling a logical schema to be defined over a range of relational, NoSQL, flat file and application / data APIs that can then be queried through a range of end points.  Supported data sources include a wide range of databases (relational, in memory, MPP, Hadoop, cloud, OLAP cube and NoSQL), flat files (Hadoop, text, binary, Office, including support for (S)FTP, compression and encryption), application APIs (e.g. Salesforce, SAP, Oracle e-business, Twitter), RDF semantic repositories via SPARQL, mainframes, data APIs (SOAP and REST), JMS queues and the ability to scrape web pages, with data accessible via SQL (JDBC, ODBC), data APIs (SOAP and REST) and web widgets (Sharepoint, Java, AJAX), with the ability to transform, cleanse and combine data from multiple sources into a single semantic model using the relevant source system query language.  Supports a dynamic query optimiser (which pushes query logic down to the underlying data source, with the ability to move data between sources and take advantage of data replicated in multiple sources to maximise logic pushdown), caching (either by query or by full materialisation, allowing tables in the semantic layer to be pre-generated, with support for scheduled and incremental updates and the use of external ETL tools), data writes back to source (with support for a distributed transaction manager and 2-phase commits), a full security model (role based access control at the row/column level, with authentication pass-through to data sources), resource and workload management, metadata visualisation (including search and lineage views), self service data discovery (execution of ad-hoc queries outside of the semantic layer), search (over data and metadata, including support for semantic mining and extraction of text sources), an SDK (for adding new source adapters, custom functions and stored procedures), and a graphical UI (supporting wizard-driven configuration, integration with external configuration management tools and release management).  Can we deployed stand alone or as a cluster (supporting both active/active and active/passive configurations and shared caches, with support for geo-replication), and is also available for AWS and as a free Denodo Express version (with limits on the number of active queries and results).  A commercial product from Denodo Technologies Inc, who were founded in 1999 with the first release of the Denodo Platform shortly afterwards."
