And so we've come to the end of the technologies included in Apache Bigtop - it's been a bit of a meandering trip, taking in some well known sights, some up and coming stuff, and some slightly odd and obscure pieces.

But time and tide wait for no man, so on we march, continuing our trip into the world of Hadoop Distributions.  Up next, it's the Hortonworks Data Platform (HDP) - we'll start by looking at HDP itself, and then move on to the technologies it includes that we haven't looked at yet.
