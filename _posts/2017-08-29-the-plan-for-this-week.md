Yes - it's a Tuesday and not a Monday.  Apologies, forgot to say on Friday that it was a public holiday in the UK this Monday, and therefore they'd be no update.  I hope you'll forgive me.

So, a shorter week this week.  The plan is to look at event series databases, both for analysing external event data, but also as a capability for analysing event logs and metrics that our analytical systems may generate.
