There are more major site updates coming, hopefully next week, but in the meantime there's been some minor updates this week...
<!--more-->

* Added Azure Time Series Insights to the [Time Series Databases](/tech-categories/time-series-databases/) tech category from which it was missing
* Added Kafka Streams to the Streaming Analytics section of the [Apache](/tech-vendors/apache/) tech vendor page from which it was missing
* Finally updated the [HDFS](/technologies/apache-hadoop/hdfs/) and [YARN](/technologies/apache-hadoop/yarn/) pages for Hadoop 3.0 and 3.1, although both these summaries could do with more work
* Finally updated the [Druid](/technologies/apache-druid/) page to rename this to Apache Druid following it's donation to the Apache Foundation
