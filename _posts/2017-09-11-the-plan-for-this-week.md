Right - time for a new week.

The observant among you may have spotted that we're working our way through data storage and database technologies before we make a start on data transformation.  There's not far to go - graph databases and analytical databases are the big ones, but we'll touch on data format libraries (Avro, Parquet et al) as well before we finish, and I need to have a think about whether I want to cover any more NoSQL technologies.

But this week, I want to look at data virtualisation technologies - those that allow you to query over and across data stored in multiple underlying platforms.  As always, we'll publish a technology category page on Friday along with some thoughts, and try and crank out some technology summaries during the week.
