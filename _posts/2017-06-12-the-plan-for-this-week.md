It's going to be a bit a a sweep up week this week - there are a number of (mostly new) technologies that have come up over the last few weeks I'd like to have a quick look at before we move onto our next technology catalogue.

So, in no particular order, the plan this week is to look at Azure Data Lake Store (scalable HDFS in the cloud - intriguing), Druid (now bundled with HDP in tech preview), Cloudera Altus (their new Data Engineering job execution service), Apache Superset (the new open source dashboard and reporting tool from AirBnB) and Pravega (the Kafka alternative from Dell EMC).

See you on Friday.
