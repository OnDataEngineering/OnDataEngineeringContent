There have been a few minor updates to the site this week...
<!--more-->

* There's a new information on [OpenLink Virtuoso Universal Server](/technologies/openlink-virtuoso-universal-server/) and updates to the [Data Virtualization](/tech-categories/data-virtualization/) tech category page for this and OpenLink Software Universal Data Access Suite courtesy of TallTed
* I've added SQData CDC and Debezium to the [Data Ingestion](/tech-categories/data-ingestion/) page.  Debezium looks interesting - an open source package of Kafka and Kafka Connect for streaming data out of databases
