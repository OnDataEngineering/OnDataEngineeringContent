It's that time of the week again, so let's look at the news.

Next week however, we're going to try something slightly difference.  We'll do the news daily (ish) over our twitter account ([@OnDataEng](https://twitter.com/OnDataEng)) for those that like Twitter, with this weekly post then summarising it for those that like RSS/newsletters, with the format of this weekly post likely to change over time.
