So we looked at data ingestion tools last week, however there was once type that we didn't include that I want to look at this week, and that's data wrangling tools - tools designed for the one off manual ingestion of data, focusing on quickly and easily cleaning and standardising data from whatever form it's in into a standard form for onwards processing.

See you at the end of the week...
