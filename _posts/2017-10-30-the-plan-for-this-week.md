So, I think we're probably done with looking at data storage and databases, however before we move on to data acquisition, processing and transformation tools, and the interesting set of supporting capabilities that live within a data ecosystem, there's a bit of housekeeping to do.

So over this week (and maybe next), expect some random updates.  I want to update and rework the technology categories home page to provide a bit more structure, and there are a few technologies I've been meaning to double back on now there should be some more documentation around beyond a press release (Hortonworks Data Plane, Cloudera SDX, MapR-XD/ES for starters).  Plus I need to work out what technology categories might be coming up.

So hang in there - new content coming, but what and when might be a little random for the next few weeks...
