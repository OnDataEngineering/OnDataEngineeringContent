We've now finished looking at the major players in the Hadoop distributions space, so I'd like to take this week to look at Hadoop and Hadoop distributions in a bit more detail, and flesh out our [Hadoop Distributions](tech-categories/hadoop_distributions/) page.
<!--more-->

There's obviously a whole pile of technologies that sit in this space we've not looked at, so first steps will be to refresh our definition of an Hadoop distribution, and try and get a slightly more complete list in place, including the Cloud Hadoop-as-a-service offerings, the smaller more boutique vendors, the appliances and maybe a footnote on the distributions that are no longer with us.

I'd then like to look at the Hadoop ecosystem in a bit more detail, and try and map out which components sit where.  I'd also like to try and do a comparison between the major offerings, focusing on the different technologies they include.  And finally, assuming I've not run out of time, a quick look at ODPI (The Open Data Platform Initiative).

Right, time to crack on - see you shortly.
