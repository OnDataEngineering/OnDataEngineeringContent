It's time for me to take a short break, both to recharge and try and get ahead of the upcoming content for the site, but also to do some work on the site itself which is starting to accumulate a few to many bodges and hacks (and an exponentially increasing build time!)

It'll be back in three weeks on Monday 14th August, and although there may be a few updates here and there between now and then, expect things to be generally quite.

Here's hoping your having a nice summer wherever you are, and we'll speak soon...
