So this week I'm planning to look at search technologies.

One of the things I want to dig into and explore is the role of search in analytics - search to support users finding stuff on your website, or to find stuff in your enterprise document management system is one thing, but what role does it play if you want to analyse and understand data.

Which means we'll probably limit our technology list to those technologies that support analytics rather than just search, but let's see how we go.

See you on Friday...
