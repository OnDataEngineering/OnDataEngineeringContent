And so we begin our journey through the jungle of Data Engineering technologies by looking at the technology du jour - Apache Hadoop.
<!--more-->

There's an entire ecosystem here that we'll start to explore by looking at the major Hadoop vendors, but the first entries in our technology catalogue are the [Apache Hadoop](/technologies/apache-hadoop/) project itself, along with its sub-projects: [YARN](/technologies/apache-hadoop/yarn/), [HDFS](/technologies/apache-hadoop/hdfs/) and [MapReduce](/technologies/apache-hadoop/map-reduce/). Click on the links to view the technology information I've added to the site. 

This also brings our first technology vendor - the [Apache Software Foundation](/tech-vendors/apache/).

And with that it's time for Christmas!  We'll be back in three weeks with the first of the core technologies within the Hadoop space.
