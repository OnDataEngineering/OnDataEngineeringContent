title: The Daily Technology Summary
categories: Site

Up until today, I've been publishing new technology summaries in bulk every Friday.  However I want to change up the pace a little, and so going forward I'm going to try to publish a new technology summary every week day.

Blog posts will be less frequent, and will usually be used to introduce and conclude a specific set of technologies we're looking it.  Because of this, you'll notice that the site home page now supports a snazzy new summary of recent changes to content on the right hand side next to the summary of recent blog posts.  In addition, the RSS and Atom feeds now include content updates as well as blog posts.

Also, in the coming days there will be new options to get the daily technology summary (and blog posts) delivered to your inbox via e-mail, and we'll also start publishing these on Twitter (@OnDataEng) as well - just as soon as it's all setup.
