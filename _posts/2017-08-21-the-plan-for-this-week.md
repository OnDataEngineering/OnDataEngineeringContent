Something slightly different this week - I've got a bunch of technology summaries to put live, most of them from Jeff Moszuti (who contributed all the recent Mesos stuff), so we're going to do a random week.  Five technology summaries, with no relationship to each other and no overlying theme.

See you on Friday for the wrap-up...
