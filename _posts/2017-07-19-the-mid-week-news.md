Technology news:

* An [introduction](https://www.elastic.co/blog/a-practical-introduction-to-elasticsearch) to [Elasticsearch](/technologies/elasticsearch/) from Elastic
* And also from Elastic on machine learning which is part of the [Elastic X-Pack](/technologies/elastic-x-pack/) - [Alerting on Machine Learning Jobs](https://www.elastic.co/blog/alerting-on-machine-learning-jobs-in-elasticsearch-v55) and [Using Machine Learning for IT Ops](https://www.elastic.co/blog/using-elasticsearch-and-machine-learning-for-it-operations)
* [Thoughts](https://yokota.blog/2017/07/12/hbase-application-archetypes-redux/) on how to store different types of data (entities, documents, graph, queue etc.) in [Hbase](/technologies/apache-hbase/)
* From ZDNet, their [introduction](http://www.zdnet.com/article/yahoos-bullet-looks-ahead-in-querying-streaming-data/) to Bullet, Yahoo's recently open source tool for querying streams of data
* It looks like Basho is no more [according to The Register](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/07/13/will_the_last_person_at_basho_get_the_lights_oh_too_late/), however there's still hope that Riak will live on
* There's now [a web GUI](https://www.swiftstack.com/blog/2017/07/11/swiftstack-client-new-easy-way-interact-swiftstack-storage/) "that an end user can use to view, upload, download, share, and manage their data in a SwiftStack cluster"

* An [article from Databricks](https://databricks.com/blog/2017/07/12/benchmarking-big-data-sql-platforms-in-the-cloud.html) on how much faster Databrinks in the cloud is that vanilla [Spark](/technologies/apache-spark) on AWS
* Via [The Register](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/07/13/scality_zenko/), Scality have released [Zenko](http://www.zenko.io/), an open source S3 gateway that can federate across multiple cloud and on premise object stores, with support to come for metadata attribute search and data management, replication and workflows.  Sounds like we should look into [object storage](/tech-categories/object-storage/) gateways at some point.
