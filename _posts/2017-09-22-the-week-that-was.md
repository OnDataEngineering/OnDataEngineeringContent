When I decided this week was graph technologies week, I think I probably knew that it was too big a topic to do in one week, and so it's proved.  So, so new content this week, but to sweeten the blow, next week there should be four technology categories and at least three technology summaries coming down the pipe.

So apologies there's not much this week, but next week should be a bumper week!
