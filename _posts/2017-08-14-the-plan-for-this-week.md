And we're back from our short break.

The plan for this week is to publish the list of Apache technologies that I think are of interest to us.  I know we're meant to be working through technology categories at the moment, but I've had this list lying around for a while and it's time to get it out of my notes and onto the site.

So no update tomorrow, news on Wednesday, Apache technology list on Thursday and some thoughts on Friday - aka back to business as usual.

And I'm still working on tidying up some bits and pieces on the site - I'll try and summarise these as and when they're ready.
