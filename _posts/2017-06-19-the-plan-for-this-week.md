title: The Plan For This Week - 19/06/2017

As promised we're going to start of this week by looking at Cloudera Altus, and then, despite the fact I've said we'll be looking at different technology categories going forward, I want to send a few days summarising the capabilities available from AWS, Azure and Google Cloud (because I have a bunch of notes I want to write up).  I then plan to close the week by actually doing what I said we'd be doing and adding a technology category, this time looking at Hadoop capabilities offered as a service (e.g. Altus), with a little rework on the [Hadoop Distributions](/tech-categories/hadoop-distributions/) page at the same time.

Have a great week, and if you're in the UK, try to stay cool.
