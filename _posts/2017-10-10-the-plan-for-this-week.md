First up, yes, we're a day late on this post - apologies.  Don't get confused - it is Tuesday today and not Monday.

So I think we have one last technology category to see off before we move on from data storage and database technologies, and that's analytical databases - those that specialise in large scanning analytical queries and that combine support for SQL with a range of other analytical capabilities.

This feels like another monster category, so don't expect much content this week, and I have a feeling it's going to be next week before we can wrap everything up.
