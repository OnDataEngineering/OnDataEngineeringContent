Good morning, and welcome back.

This week we will mostly be looking at in memory databases, grids and whatever else they want to call themselves.  If I come across some interesting technologies I'll try and knock out a couple of technology summaries, but my guess is that most of this week will be spent reading to try and get my head around this space.

So news on Wednesday, a technology category page and associated thoughts on Friday, and maybe a technology summary or two somewhere along the way.
