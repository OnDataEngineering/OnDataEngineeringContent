title: The Plan For This Week - 20/11/2017

So I said last week was going to be the last catch up week, but (as is becoming a depressingly predictable pattern recently) I'm going to overrun.

However, I've been taking the time to do some well needed structural updates to the site - hopefully sorting my SEO problem, and allowing me to publish new custom technology, vendor and category index pages this week.

So, bear with me please.  Some final updates this week and then next we'll start on our final set of technology categories before we move onto Chapter 3.
