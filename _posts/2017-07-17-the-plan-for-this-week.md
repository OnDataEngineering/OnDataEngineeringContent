Right, it's going a quiet week for me (but not the site) this week, as we have a bunch of technology summaries on Apache Mesos and some of it's associated technologies from Jeff Moszuti.

Jeff also supplied the technology summary for Apache Cassandra last week, however I very rudely forgot to credit him in the wrap up post on Friday - apologies Jeff.

I'll be back on Wednesday with an update on the news, and back on Friday with some thoughts on cluster management, but until then I'll leave you in Jeff's capable hands.
